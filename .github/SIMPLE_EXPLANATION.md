# GitHub Workflows Explained Simply

## What is Dependabot?

Dependabot is GitHub's built-in robot that watches your `package.json` file for outdated packages and automatically creates pull requests to update them.

### How it works (completely automatic):

1. **Scans weekly** - Every Monday at 9 AM, it checks if you have outdated packages
2. **Creates PRs** - If it finds updates, it creates pull requests for you
3. **Groups packages** - Related packages (like all Svelte stuff) get grouped into one PR
4. **You decide** - You review the PR and merge it if everything looks good

### What you'll see:

- Pull requests with titles like "chore: bump @sveltejs/kit from 2.16.0 to 2.17.0"
- Maximum 5 PRs at once (so it doesn't spam you)
- Automatic labels: `dependencies`, `automated`

**No setup needed** - GitHub handles everything automatically once you commit the `dependabot.yml` file.

## What are GitHub Workflows?

Think of workflows as **automated helpers** that run checks on your code. They're like having a quality control team that works 24/7.

### The 3 Main Workflows:

## 1. CI Workflow (`ci.yml`)

**When:** Runs every time you push code or create a pull request  
**What it does:**

- Checks code formatting with Prettier
- Runs ESLint to catch potential bugs
- Validates TypeScript types
- Makes sure your Svelte components compile correctly
- Builds the entire app to make sure nothing is broken
- Runs unit tests
- Checks security vulnerabilities
- Validates that all your Musical Zoe components exist (widgets, API routes, etc.)

**Think of it as:** Your personal code reviewer that never sleeps

## 2. Quality Workflow (`quality.yml`)

**When:** Runs with every push/PR + weekly on Mondays  
**What it does:**

- Analyzes code complexity (warns if files get too big)
- Checks bundle size (how big your built app is)
- Scans for accessibility issues (alt text, ARIA labels, etc.)
- Looks for performance problems
- Validates security patterns
- Checks API consistency across your music endpoints
- Generates quality reports you can download

**Think of it as:** A health checkup for your codebase

## 3. Dependencies Workflow (`dependencies.yml`)

**When:** Runs weekly on Mondays + you can trigger it manually  
**What it does:**

- Scans for security vulnerabilities in your packages
- Checks if packages have compatible licenses
- Automatically updates safe packages (patch versions only)
- Analyzes how updates affect your bundle size
- Creates pull requests for safe updates
- Fails the build if critical security issues are found

**Think of it as:** Your security guard and maintenance crew

## How Do They Work Together?

```
You push code to GitHub
         ↓
CI Workflow runs automatically
         ↓
Checks formatting, types, builds, tests
         ↓
If everything passes: ✅ Green checkmark
If something fails: ❌ Red X with details
```

```
Weekly Schedule:
Monday 8 AM: Dependencies workflow checks for security issues
Monday 9 AM: Dependabot scans for package updates
Monday 9 AM: Quality workflow does health checkup
```

## What You Need to Do:

### Daily:

- **Nothing!** Just push your code normally
- Check if workflows pass (green checkmarks in GitHub)
- Fix any issues if workflows fail (red X)

### Weekly:

- Review Dependabot PRs (usually safe to merge)
- Check quality reports if you want insights
- Review any security alerts

### Never:

- You don't need to configure anything
- You don't need to change GitHub settings
- Everything is automatic

## Where to See Results:

1. **In your repository** - Go to the "Actions" tab to see all workflow runs
2. **On pull requests** - You'll see green checkmarks or red X's
3. **In notifications** - GitHub will notify you of any issues
4. **Quality reports** - Download from completed workflow runs

The workflows are specifically designed for Musical Zoe, so they understand your:

- Svelte components and widgets
- Music API endpoints
- Dashboard layout
- Tailwind CSS setup
- TypeScript configuration

Everything just works automatically once you commit these files!
